# reactive-spring-boot-angular-moviestar
This example app shows how to build a basic non-blocking reactive full stack app with Spring Boot 2.0, Spring Data, and Angular 5.0.

The server(Backend) part provides two REST APIs, `/stars` and `/stars/{id}` that return data from a reactive MongoDB database. And accessing all other actuator endpoints(eg. `/actuator/info`, `/actuator/env`) requires authorization which is empowered by Spring Security(usernmae,passwords are configured in [application.properties](src/main/resources/application.properties)).The programming language for backend is using Kotlin. And it brings with a [Kotlin routing DSL](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/5.0.4.RELEASE/kdoc-api/spring-framework/org.springframework.web.reactive.function.server/-router-function-dsl/) that allows one to leverage the [WebFlux functional API](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/web-reactive.html#webflux-fn) for writing clean and idiomatic code. 

The client(Frontend) part is using Angular 5 to present the data list from REST API and provied operation on them. And also add function to retrieve movie star images from a public open movie and TV database [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api?language=en).

**Prerequisites:** [Java 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) (Kotlin TargetJVM 1.8) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

## Getting Started

To install this example application, run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ujjeeq/reactive-spring-boot-angular-moviestar.git
cd reactive-spring-boot-angular-moviestar
```

This will get a copy of the project installed locally. To install all of its dependencies and start each app, follow the instructions below.

To run the server, directly run:
 
```bash
./gradlew bootRun
```
then to reach the REST APIs on `http://localhost:8080/stars `;

And with username/password set in [application.properties](src/main/resources/application.properties), it is possible to access actuator endpoints, like:
```bash
 curl -u abc:abc123 http://localhost:8080/actuator/info
```
or by using browsers.

Also there is social Oauth 2.0 login function to access those endpoint.

To run the client, cd into the `client` folder and run:
 
```bash
npm install && npm start
```
then to check the FrontEnd on `http://localhost:4200/ `.
